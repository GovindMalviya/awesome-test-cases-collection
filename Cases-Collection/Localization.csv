S.No.,Test Case,Type of Test Case (Positive / Negative),Remarks
1,Ensure all UI elements are isolated in the localizable resources.,Positive,
2,Pseudo-localization should not leave any unlocalized text in the UI.,Positive,
3,"The text that appears in the graphical user interface (GUI), verify that the following text is localizable.",Positive,
4,Verify that  parts of the command-line interface.,Positive,
5,Verify parts of the command-line interface should be localizable.,Positive,
6,Verify messages in the Event Log and Error Log should be localizable.,Positive,
7,Verify error messages should be localizable.,Positive,
8,Verify tool tips should be localizable.,Positive,
9,"Check that static UI text (such as names of dialog boxes, field labels, tabs, and other things the user cannot change) is displayed in the language of the application's UI",Positive,
10,"Verify that there should be no question marks, default glyphs, or random characters in the UI.",Positive,
11,Make sure that random pseudo-localization does not affect the functionality of the application.,Positive,
12,"Names of some elements (such as Help files, satellite DLLs, IRIs, database files, field names and other code elements, etc.) that the application uses should not be localized.",Positive,
13,"If pseudo-localization were to change these names, applications wouldn't be able to find their databases.",Positive,
14,Font properties must not be in localizable resources.,Positive,
15,Applications violating this rule are likely to use an incorrect font face and size if pseudo-localized.,Positive,
16,Verify that applications are not affected if the size of the font or screen resolution is changed.,Positive,
17,"Ensure pseudo-localization doesn't affect the following areas: hot keys, keyboard shortcuts, and accelerators; menus; responses (such as [Y][N]) required by command-line applications; and other UI control elements.",Positive,
18,"All of the areas just listed must be accessible on a localized platform, even if the input does not match the UI language of the application.",Positive,
19,Growth of the UI text length due to pseudo-localization should not cause text clipping,Positive,
20,For all non-textual resources (such as images and sounds) that must be localized,Positive,
21,Verify that the dynamic-string composition can hold if the order of parts of the output must be changed.,Positive,
22,"The names of built-in accounts such as ""Administrator"" or folders such as ""Program Files"" must be retrieved dynamically",Positive,
23,Pseudo-localize the application and run it on a localized platform.,Positive,
